<h1>Schmessage Faqs</h1>
<p id="Description">A service for <b>Sch</b>eduling <b>message</b>s for later on GroupMe</p>
<br/>

<h3>What is this?</h3>
<p>It's a simple service for scheduling messages to be sent later on GroupMe</p>
<br/>

<h3>What is it for?</h3>
<p>It's for lots of things!</p>
<p>Want to be sure to tell your friend happy birthday but don't want to forget? Schedule it a week in advance!</p>
<p>Want to send a good morning message to all your buddies? Schedule a message for 9am! Or... Whenever you think morning is. </p>
<p>Want to send out a reminder but are afraid you'll forget yourself? Schedule it before you forget! </p>
<p>Want to send a ton of information at once but don't want people interrupting while you're typing out the next part of the info? Schedule all of them for the same time so they all send at once!</p>
<p>Want to spam your friends with tons of messages at once? We don't recommend it, but you do you!</p>
<br/>

<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>It's fairly simple! Just log in with GroupMe, select a chat, then select a date and time for your message, then type your message!</p>
<br/>

<h3>Okay, but how does it WORK?</h3>

<br/>

<h3>Can I cancel a message?</h3>
<p>Yep! If you have any scheduled messages, they should appear under the form to make one, as well as a button for each to cancel. If you don't see a message there, it's probably not going to be sent, but if it's something of major importance, feel free to contact me and I can check!</p>
<br/>

<h3>Is there any limit to how many I can schedule?</h3>
<p>Nope! That said, if you schedule 1000 messages at once, I can't guarantee all of them will send. It's not magic, after all.</p>
<br/>

<h3>Is there a limit to how far in advance I can schedule a message?</h3>
<p>Well... No, but don't count on anything scheduled for more than a year out to be dependable.</p>
<br/>

<h3>When I click on the log in link, it doesn't do anything!</h3>
<p>Sometimes browsers don't handle change all that well - try refreshing the page, clicking the link again, or waiting a few minutes and trying again. If none of that works, send me an email!</p>
<br/>

<h3>Are there any plans to bring this service to any other platforms?</h3>
<p>Yep! While I can't make any promises, I intend to also support Discord and Twitter in the future.</p>
<br/>

<h3>I have a problem/question/suggestion! How can I contact you?</h3>
<p>Feel free to send me an email at 2CATteam@gmail.com!</p>
